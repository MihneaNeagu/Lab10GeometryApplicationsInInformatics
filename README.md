Write a Python program to determine a point on a rational Bézier cubic curve, in the plane, using de Casteljau's rational algorithm.
The input data will be:

• the 4 control points;

• the 4 weights;

• t∈[0,1], and the result must be r(t).

The input data must be able to be entered interactively or through to a fis, give data. If you chose the second option, an example of a data file is also attached to the program.
